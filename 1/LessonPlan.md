### Overview

write overview of today's class

### Class Objectives 

# Declarative Memory Objectives (concepts/facts/semantics)

* objective 1

* objective 2

# Procedural Memory Objectives (learn by doing/type and hand write code)

* Complete syntax coding activity (notebook) 

* Write a calculator console application. (Visual Studio)

* Write simple OOP console application(Visual Studio)
**Goal of this activity is to have students remember basic objective oriented programming principles that are needed for a simple a web application. (last activity)

* Write a simple ASP.NET MVC

### Class Slides

### 1. Instructor Do: Course pre-reqs and pace (2 min)

explain prereqs and assumptions. recommend resource to catch up. Installing

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce .NET  (15 min)
talk about .NET and a high level overview of all that is possible
why .NET

### 4. Instructor Do: go over basic syntaxs (5 min)

### 5. Instructor Do: Talk about visual studio and create sample project (5 min)
project will be the Ins_console_app, add 2 functions.

### 6. Instructor Do: Ask students about classes, objects, methods, properties (5 min) 
If students catch on quickly then review basic OOP concepts 

### 7. Student Do (Individual Activity): Programming the rust out on paper. (5 min)
Have students write with pen and paper a class that contains a method called main(). The method will write "hello world" to a console.
This activity needs to be done in c#. Emphasize to the students that the best way to fully learn a new language is to write it down with pen/pencil and paper. This is a form of procedural learning.

### 8. Instructor Do: Introduce the web stack of .NET (5 min)

### 9. Instructor Do: Implement logic from console app into web application (8 minutes)

### 10. Student Do: Add more functionality to Calc_Web_App (10 min)
Encourage student to take this application and continue to add more functionalilty to it after class. If time permits go over the solution file during class. Begin the next class with a brief review of this activity solution.
