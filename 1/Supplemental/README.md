### Reasoning behind questions being asked.

Q1) To avoid the serial position effect and truely reinforce the concept of namespace (number 4 in lecture), it would be best to reinforce this concept first. As far as the good practice part, it depends on the design pattern. In industry good practice is a relative term. The follow-up question is meant to spark up a discussion amount students and therefore hitting home the concept of namespaces. 

Q2) The purpose of this question is to get the students to play the clip real in their head. They most likely wont remeber the clip , but the act of them thinking about it will spark up that memory. The correct answer is actually in the clip, it shows how you can set a break point on a value (*break when value change*). It's a different way of setting a break point (which we did meantion in class) but by now the student will never forget that specific debug feature. Another possible answer is git integration.

Q3)This is a retrieval question. The answer is Index.cshtml.cs . The follow up question was not discussed in class and requires some reasoning, but in short the answer is yes as long as you set it up properly.

Q4) The reliability of all microsoft from a latent scale. I would wait about 5 minutes for the students to come to a dead end and then relate .NET to other *try and true* languages that are still holding up.
