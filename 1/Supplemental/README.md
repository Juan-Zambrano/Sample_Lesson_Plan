# Part 2

This section consist of 5 questions for the instructor to ask at the end of class in order to assess whether students are on the right track.

### Questions
---
1) Is it possible to have the same name for a class? If so is it good practice.

2) Using visual studio in debug mode provides a wide range of features that are beneficial in an enterprise setting. What is one feature in debug mode that we did not meantion in class? Hint *Think back to clip we played in class*

3) In a razor page web app which file ending containings the html code that we see in the browser. Is it possible to write native c# in it?

4) What is a pro about the .NET platform that get's overlooked often?

5) When would you pick a .NET Framework vs .NET Core and vice versa?

### Reasoning behind questions being asked.

Q1) To avoid the serial position effect and truely reinforce the concept of namespace (number 4 in lecture), it would be best to reinforce this concept first. As far as the good practice part, it depends on the design pattern. In industry good practice is a relative term. The follow-up question is meant to spark up a discussion amount students and therefore hitting home the concept of namespaces. 

Q2) The purpose of this question is to get the students to play the clip real in their head. They most likely wont remeber the clip , but the act of them thinking about it will spark up that memory. The correct answer is actually in the clip, it shows how you can set a break point on a value (*break when value change*). It's a different way of setting a break point (which we did meantion in class) but by now the student will never forget that specific debug feature. Another possible answer is git integration.

Q3)This is a retrieval question. The answer is Index.cshtml.cs . The follow up question was not discussed in class and requires some reasoning, but in short the answer is yes as long as you set it up properly.

Q4)This is an inference question. The reliability of .NET from a latent scale. I would wait about 5 minutes for the students to come to a dead end and then relate .NET to other *try and true* languages that are still holding up. In realilty too this day their are old pick basic programming in production settings therefore it would not be out of the ordinary for .NET Core applications to hold up till 2060.

Q5) The answer to this question would not have been said explicitly but in general if working in a production windows setting needing quick support and high reliability .NET Framework 4.6 -4.7 would be the best solution. If the you need cross platform/ML.net or other app models not supported by .NET Framework 4.6 -4.7 then .NET Core would be the best solution. This question would need to be asked last since it is the first topic covered (same reason as to asking question 1 first). This question is designed to catalyze conversation and inference.
